## About the plugins

Obsidian by default does not support the viewing and editing of various code files, and Obsidian VSCode Editor was created to solve this problem. 

It is based on [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) (VSCode Editor kernel) development, support for viewing and editing of various code format files, including but not limited to: ` C `, `C++`, `C#` , ` CSS `, ` Go `, ` HTML`, `Java`, `JavaScript`, `JSON`, `Python`, `Ruby`, `Rust`, `Shell`, `XML`, `YAML`, `ini`, etc.

You no longer have to open another editor just to view or edit a certain code file, everything is done in Obsidian.


## Basic features
- It **does not depend on** any third-party network services and can be used even when not connected to the internet.
- Support for viewing and editing files in various code formats, just like editing code with VSCode.
- Supports customization of the editor's theme colors, including light and dark themes.
- Allows customization of the editor's font size, and provides a shortcut to adjust the font size using `Ctrl + mouse wheel`.
- Supports editing individual code blocks from any Markdown document.
- Supports Internal links quick preview.
- Supports automatic code wrapping, and toggles it with `alt + z`.
- Provides the option to show/hide line numbers.
- Offers the choice to display/hide indent guides.
- Allows toggling the display of the code minimap.
- Supports shortcut icon buttons or commands for creating new code files.

## How to support different code file
